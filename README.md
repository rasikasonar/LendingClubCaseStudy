## General Information
- The case study analyses the data of a finance company who gives loans at affordable interest rates
- The goal is to analyse the historical data of loan applicants, some of whom have paid off the entire loan whereas some of them have defaulted.
- The outcome of the case study is to help the finance company in deciding whether a new loan applicant is likely to pay the loan or whether they are less likely to repay the loan.
- For the applicants who are less likely to repay the loan the company can make decision to either reject their loan or to give loan at higher interest rate
- The dataset being analysed for this case study is "loan.csv" file


## Conclusions
- Loan when taken for the purpose of DEBT CONSOLIDATION is more likely to be defaulted
- Loan applicants who have been employed for a longer period of time (say more than 10 years) are more likely to default the loan
- Loan applicants who have been living on RENT or MORTGAGE are less likely to repay the loan
- There are grades allocated to a loan applicants from A to G by LC. The applicants with grades after C are more likely to default the loan
- Every loan applicant's income is verified. If not verified would result in more chances of getting defaulted.
